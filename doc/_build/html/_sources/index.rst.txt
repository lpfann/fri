Overview
=========
`FRI` is a Python 3 package for analytical feature selection purposes.
It allows superior feature selection in the sense that all important features are conserved.
At the moment we support multiple linear models for solving Classification, Regression and Ordinal Regression Problems.
We also support LUPI paradigm where at learning time, privileged information is available.

Check out the :ref:`Quick Start Guide </notebooks/Guide.ipynb>` for a practical introduction.
For theoretical explanations look at the :doc:`background` or read the :doc:`references` for the long version.

The source code can be found at `GitHub <https://github.com/lpfann/fri>`_.
