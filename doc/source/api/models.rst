Models
=======

FRI includes models for different problem types.
Internally the behavior is encoded in the following classes which should **not** be used directly.
If you want to extend the functionality try to inherit from :class:`fri.base_type.ProblemType.` or one of these listed.
If you want to use `FRI` for analysis instantiate :class:`fri.FRI` instead.

.. automodule:: fri.model
